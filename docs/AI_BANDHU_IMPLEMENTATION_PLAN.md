# AI Bandhu Integration Plan

## Overview
AI Bandhu is a bilingual (Hindi/English) AI-powered assistant layer for Retail Bandhu that provides role-specific dashboards and voice-enabled order management for three user types: Retailers, Wholesalers, and Delivery Partners.

## Architecture

### Non-Disruptive Integration
- All AI Bandhu features live in separate routes: `/ai-bandhu/*`
- No modifications to existing Retail Bandhu code
- Uses existing Supabase authentication and user profiles
- Leverages existing role-based access control system

### Role-Based Dashboards
1. **Retailer Dashboard** (`/ai-bandhu/retailer`)
   - Voice-enabled order placement
   - AI-powered product recommendations
   - Order tracking with AI insights
   - Bilingual chat support

2. **Wholesaler Dashboard** (`/ai-bandhu/wholesaler`)
   - Voice-enabled order management
   - Inventory insights with AI analysis
   - Delivery partner coordination
   - Bilingual chat support

3. **Delivery Partner Dashboard** (`/ai-bandhu/delivery-partner`)
   - Voice-enabled delivery tracking
   - Route optimization suggestions
   - Real-time notifications
   - Bilingual chat support

## Database Schema Extensions

### New Tables Required
1. `ai_bandhu_conversations` - Store chat conversations
2. `ai_bandhu_messages` - Store individual messages
3. `ai_bandhu_voice_logs` - Store voice interaction logs
4. `ai_bandhu_insights` - Store AI-generated insights

### Existing Tables Used
- `profiles` - User authentication and roles
- `orders` - Order data
- `products` - Product catalog
- `delivery_partners` - Delivery partner info

## API Endpoints

### Chat & Voice APIs
- `POST /api/ai-bandhu/chat/message` - Send chat message
- `POST /api/ai-bandhu/voice/transcribe` - Transcribe voice to text
- `POST /api/ai-bandhu/voice/synthesize` - Convert text to speech
- `GET /api/ai-bandhu/conversations` - Get user conversations

### Insights APIs
- `GET /api/ai-bandhu/insights/orders` - Get order insights
- `GET /api/ai-bandhu/insights/inventory` - Get inventory insights
- `GET /api/ai-bandhu/insights/delivery` - Get delivery insights

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Database & Auth)
- Create AI Bandhu database tables
- Set up Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- Create protected routes with role-based access

### Phase 2: Chat System
- Build chat interface component
- Implement message storage and retrieval
- Add bilingual support (Hindi/English)
- Integrate with GPT-4 for AI responses

### Phase 3: Voice Integration
- Add voice input component
- Integrate speech-to-text API
- Implement text-to-speech for responses
- Add voice command parsing

### Phase 4: Role-Specific Dashboards
- Build Retailer dashboard with order placement
- Build Wholesaler dashboard with inventory management
- Build Delivery Partner dashboard with tracking
- Add AI-powered insights for each role

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- Test all role-based access controls
- Verify voice functionality
- Test bilingual support
- Deploy to production

## Security Considerations

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Users can only access their own conversations
   - Users can only see data relevant to their role

2. **API Authentication**
   - All endpoints require valid Supabase session
   - Role verification on each request

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Voice logs encrypted at rest
   - Conversations tied to user ID
   - No cross-user data leakage

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 via AI SDK
- **Voice**: Web Speech API (browser) + optional cloud service
- **Bilingual**: i18n library for Hindi/English support

## Success Metrics

1. Chat system fully functional with GPT-4 integration
2. Voice input/output working for all roles
3. All role-based dashboards accessible and functional
4. Bilingual support working for Hindi and English
5. All data properly secured with RLS policies
6. Zero disruption to existing Retail Bandhu functionality
